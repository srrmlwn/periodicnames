## Phase 2: Visual Design & Periodic Table
**Goal**: Make it look good and add the interactive periodic table

### Periodic Table

- [x] Add lanthanides and actinides rows
- [x] Implement hover-based expansion (1.5x scale)
- [x] Add atomic mass display on hover
- [x] Maintain font size in expanded state

### Styling
- [x] Style element tiles with proper colors
- [x] Style fake elements differently (different color)
- [x] Make it responsive for mobile
- [x] Add hover effects
- [x] Clean up ResultDisplay to use ElementTile components
- [x] Fix spacing and sizing in result display

### Visual Polish
- [x] Add loading states
- [x] Add error handling
- [x] Improve typography and spacing
- [x] Remove cruft from ResultDisplay (title, stats)
- [x] Position atomic number and mass closer to edges

**Deliverable**: Beautiful, responsive periodic table with proper styling ✅ **COMPLETE**

### Phase 2 Implementation Details
- ✅ ElementTile component with square design, proper colors, and hover effects
- ✅ PeriodicTable component with grid layout and element highlighting
- ✅ Interactive elements with click handlers and visual feedback
- ✅ Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- ✅ Enhanced ResultDisplay with better visual hierarchy and statistics
- ✅ Improved Header with gradient text and better typography
- ✅ Enhanced NameInput with gradient button and better UX
- ✅ Element highlighting system that shows used elements in results
- ✅ Color-coded element categories (alkali, transition, noble, etc.)
- ✅ Fake elements styled with dashed borders and gray colors
- ✅ Hover effects and transitions for better interactivity
- ✅ **NEW**: Complete periodic table with lanthanides and actinides (9 rows total)
- ✅ **NEW**: Hover-based expansion (1.5x scale) with smooth animations
- ✅ **NEW**: Atomic mass display in top-right corner on hover
- ✅ **NEW**: Font size preservation in expanded state (no text scaling)
- ✅ **NEW**: Clean ResultDisplay using ElementTile components
- ✅ **NEW**: Proper element ordering (shows elements in name order, not grouped)
- ✅ **NEW**: Space handling with visual dot representation
- ✅ **NEW**: Silly fake element names with random selection (3 options per letter)
- ✅ **NEW**: Self-contained ElementTile with internal click state management
- ✅ **NEW**: Optional props with defaults for better encapsulation

## Phase 3: Animations & Polish
**Goal**: Add smooth animations and final polish

### Animations
- [x] Replace harsh blue ring highlighting with elegant glow effects
- [x] Add staggered animations for multiple element highlights
- [x] Implement category-based glow colors
- [x] Add smooth hover transitions with proper z-index handling
- [x] Create custom CSS animations for pulse and glow effects
- [x] Add sequential element reveals in ResultDisplay
- [x] Implement smooth success message timing

### Final Polish
- [x] Enhanced hover effects with 1.5x scaling
- [x] Proper z-index management for hover states
- [x] Consistent font sizes across all states
- [x] Ellipsis truncation for long element names
- [x] Smooth loading animations with staggered timing

### Deployment
- [ ] Set up Vercel deployment

- ✅ **Category-Based Glow Colors**: Different glow colors for alkali (red), metalloid (blue), noble (pink), etc.
- ✅ **Staggered Animations**: 50ms delays between multiple highlighted elements
- ✅ **Enhanced Hover Effects**: 1.5x scaling with proper z-index (z-30) to override highlighted elements
- ✅ **Smooth Transitions**: 300ms duration with cubic-bezier easing for natural feel
- ✅ **ResultDisplay Animations**: Sequential element reveals with 100ms delays and proper success message timing
- ✅ **NameInput Enhancements**: Typing feedback, animated cursor, loading dots with staggered animation
- ✅ **Z-Index Hierarchy**: Hover (z-30) > Highlighted (z-20) > Normal (base) for proper layering
- ✅ **Font Size Consistency**: Maintained 10px font size across all states with proper scaling
- ✅ **Ellipsis Truncation**: Clean truncation for long element names with consistent behavior
- ✅ **Success Message Timing**: Appears after all element animations complete with calculated delays
