# Task List - Periodic Names

## Phase 1: Core Setup & Basic Functionality
**Goal**: Get the basic app working with name input and element matching

### Setup Tasks
- [x] Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite project
- [x] Set up Tailwind CSS
- [x] Create basic project structure
- [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier

### Core Data
- [x] Create elements data (real periodic table elements)
- [x] Create fake elements data (small database of fun fake elements)
- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces

### Basic Components
- [x] Create Header component (title + subtitle)
- [x] Create NameInput component (text input + submit button)
- [x] Create basic ResultDisplay component (show elements used)

### Core Algorithm
- [x] Implement element matching algorithm
- [x] Test with sample names (Sriram, Carlos, Moses)
- [x] Ensure case insensitive input

**Deliverable**: Basic working app where you can enter a name and see the element breakdown

### Implementation Details
- ✅ React + TypeScript + Vite project initialized
- ✅ Tailwind CSS configured with custom config (PostCSS issue resolved - downgraded to stable v3.4.17)
- ✅ Project structure created with components/, hooks/, data/, utils/, types/ directories
- ✅ Complete periodic table data (118 real elements) with categories and properties
- ✅ Fake elements data for letters not in periodic table (A-Z coverage)
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for NameResult, AnimationState, ElementMatcherResult
- ✅ Greedy element matching algorithm that prioritizes real elements
- ✅ Header component with title and subtitle
- ✅ NameInput component with form validation and loading states
- ✅ ResultDisplay component showing element breakdown with real/fake distinction
- ✅ Main App component integrating all functionality
- ✅ Development server running and ready for testing

## Phase 2: Visual Design & Periodic Table
**Goal**: Make it look good and add the interactive periodic table

### Periodic Table
- [ ] Create ElementTile component (square design per specs)
- [ ] Create PeriodicTable component (grid layout)
- [ ] Add element highlighting for used elements
- [ ] Make elements clickable (optional interaction)

### Styling
- [ ] Style element tiles with proper colors
- [ ] Style fake elements differently (different color)
- [ ] Make it responsive for mobile
- [ ] Add hover effects

### Visual Polish
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Improve typography and spacing

**Deliverable**: Beautiful, responsive periodic table with proper styling

---

## Phase 3: Animations & Polish
**Goal**: Add smooth animations and final polish

### Animations
- [ ] Add Framer Motion
- [ ] Animate name transformation on submit
- [ ] Animate element highlighting
- [ ] Add smooth transitions

### Final Polish
- [ ] Add copy-to-clipboard for results
- [ ] Add basic social sharing buttons
- [ ] Test on different devices
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Deployment
- [ ] Set up Vercel deployment
- [ ] Configure custom domain (periodicnames.com)
- [ ] Test production build

**Deliverable**: Complete, polished website ready for users

---

## Phase 4: Optional Enhancements (Future)
**Goal**: Add extra features if needed

### Possible Additions
- [ ] Analytics tracking
- [ ] SEO optimization
- [ ] Print-on-demand integration
- [ ] More fake element names
- [ ] User favorites (if needed)

---

## Development Guidelines

### Keep It Simple
- Focus on core functionality first
- Don't over-engineer features
- Test frequently with real names
- Prioritize user experience over fancy features

### Testing Strategy
- Test with various name lengths
- Test with names that need many fake elements
- Test mobile responsiveness
- Test animation performance

### Success Criteria
- [ ] User can enter any name and get a result
- [ ] Real elements are prioritized over fake ones
- [ ] Website looks good on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Animations are smooth and not overwhelming
- [ ] Site loads quickly and is responsive

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1**: 2-3 days
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 days  
- **Phase 3**: 1-2 days
- **Total**: 5-8 days for MVP

## Notes
- Start with the simplest possible implementation
- Add complexity only when needed
- Focus on making it fun and engaging
- Keep the codebase clean and maintainable
